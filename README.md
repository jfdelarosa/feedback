# PulseKit 

![PulseKit](https://trypulsekit.com)

PulseKit is a lightweight, embeddable feedback system designed for modern SaaS teams. It helps product teams capture insights directly from their users‚Äîwithout requiring them to sign up for another platform. Built with developers in mind, PulseKit integrates natively into any web app via a simple SDK or Web Component.

## üí° Overview

PulseKit allows your users to:

* Submit feedback without creating a new account
* Vote and comment on ideas directly inside your product

For your team, it offers:

* A simple dashboard to manage ideas and suggestions
* A structured feedback loop that fits into your product workflows
* Customization and branding to make it feel like part of your app

## ü§î Why It Exists

Feedback tools often live outside your product, creating friction and context switching. PulseKit removes that barrier by making feedback native‚Äîusers never have to leave your app or deal with a separate login. It's a better experience for them and more actionable for you.


## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo with the following main components:

- **Platform App** (`apps/platform`): The website and dashboard for teams to manage feedback and settings
- **Embed Widget** (`apps/embed`): The embeddable component that gets integrated into client applications
- **API** (`packages/api`): Backend services and endpoints

PulseKit is built using:

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh)**: JavaScript/TypeScript runtime and package manager
