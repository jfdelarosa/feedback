# PRD: PulseKit Embed SDK

## 1. Product overview
### 1.1 Document title and version
- PRD: PulseKit Embed SDK
- Version: 1.0

### 1.2 Product summary
PulseKit Embed SDK is a lightweight JavaScript library that enables developers to easily integrate PulseKit's feedback collection capabilities into their web applications. The SDK provides simple initialization and user identification methods that work seamlessly with the PulseKit Board web component.

This SDK serves as the integration layer between client applications and the PulseKit platform, allowing users to submit feedback, vote on ideas, and view product updates without leaving the host application.

## 2. Goals
### 2.1 Business goals
- Simplify the integration process for developers implementing PulseKit
- Increase adoption of PulseKit by making it easier to embed
- Create a standardized way for customers to initialize and configure the feedback widget
- Establish a secure authentication mechanism for API communication
- Enable customer applications to identify their users to PulseKit

### 2.2 User goals
- As a developer, easily integrate PulseKit into any web application with minimal code
- As a developer, securely authenticate with the PulseKit API using an API key
- As a developer, configure PulseKit's behavior to match specific application needs
- As a developer, pass user identity information to personalize the feedback experience
- As an end-user, submit feedback within the host application without additional authentication

### 2.3 Non-goals
- Providing a full-featured JavaScript API beyond initialization and identification
- Supporting initialization in non-web environments (mobile native, desktop)
- Building custom rendering logic outside the web component
- Handling advanced authentication flows like OAuth
- Creating a TypeScript-only SDK that can't be used with vanilla JavaScript

## 3. User personas
### 3.1 Key user types
- Web developers
- Product managers
- End users of applications with PulseKit embedded

### 3.2 Basic persona details
- **Web Developer**: Technical professional responsible for integrating PulseKit into their organization's web application
- **Product Manager**: Non-technical or semi-technical team member who configures and manages PulseKit after integration
- **End User**: Person using the application where PulseKit is embedded, who will submit feedback or view updates

### 3.3 Role-based access
- **Web Developer**: Can initialize the SDK, configure options, and implement user identification
- **Product Manager**: Uses the PulseKit platform dashboard to manage feedback data collected through the SDK
- **End User**: Can interact with the feedback board component once it's properly initialized

## 4. Functional requirements
- **SDK Initialization** (Priority: High)
  - Provide an `init(apiKey, options)` function that initializes the SDK
  - Support an optional `options` parameter with configuration settings
  - Include the ability to specify a custom API base URL in options
  - Store initialization state for later use by the board component
  - Apply any provided configuration to all subsequent API requests
  - Validate the API key format before attempting to use it
  
- **User Identification** (Priority: High)
  - Provide an `identify(user)` function to associate feedback with specific users
  - Accept user properties including `id`, `email`, and `avatar`
  - Store user information for use in API requests
  - Validate required user properties and format
  
- **Web Component Integration** (Priority: High)
  - Ensure the board web component can access SDK initialization state
  - Make the board component perform API requests with the stored API key as auth header
  - Pass user identity information to API requests when available
  
- **Error Handling** (Priority: Medium)
  - Provide clear error messages for initialization failures
  - Handle API connectivity issues gracefully
  - Log appropriate debugging information when errors occur

## 5. User experience
### 5.1. Entry points & first-time user flow
- Developer adds the SDK script to their application
- Developer calls the `init` function with their API key
- Developer adds the board web component to their application's DOM
- Developer optionally calls the `identify` function when user context is available
- End user interacts with the fully initialized feedback board

### 5.2. Core experience
- **SDK Initialization**: Developer includes the SDK in their application and calls the init function
  - Clear documentation makes it simple to understand the initialization process
  - Error messages are descriptive and actionable if initialization fails
- **User Identification**: Developer calls the identify function when user information is available
  - Feedback submitted after identification is associated with the identified user
  - User's avatar and name appear in the feedback interface when provided
- **Board Component Usage**: The board component automatically uses the initialized SDK
  - No additional configuration required beyond adding the component to the DOM
  - Component displays appropriate loading and error states

### 5.3. Advanced features & edge cases
- Handling re-initialization with different API keys
- Changing user identity during a session
- Recovering from network failures during API requests
- Responding to invalid API keys or unauthorized responses
- Working with single-page applications where the component may be mounted and unmounted

### 5.4. UI/UX highlights
- Zero-configuration required for basic use cases
- Non-intrusive error messaging for developers
- Chainable API methods for cleaner code
- Consistent with modern JavaScript SDK patterns
- No UI elements introduced by the SDK itself (all UI handled by web component)

## 6. Narrative
Sarah is a frontend developer at a growing SaaS company who needs to collect user feedback without sending customers to external platforms. She discovers PulseKit and is delighted by how simple it is to implement. With just a few lines of code to initialize the SDK and add the board component, she has a fully-functional feedback system embedded in her application. When users submit feedback, it appears in the company's PulseKit dashboard, and Sarah's product team can respond directly. Because the SDK identifies users automatically using their existing account information, customers never have to create separate logins or leave the application.

## 8. Technical considerations
### 8.1. Integration points
- The SDK must interface with the PulseKit API
- The board web component must access SDK state
- Host applications must be able to initialize the SDK
- The SDK must support various JavaScript module systems (ESM, CommonJS)
- The SDK might need to communicate with other PulseKit components in the future

### 8.2. Data storage & privacy
- API keys must be stored securely and never exposed to end users
- User identification information must be handled according to privacy best practices
- The SDK should not store any data in persistent browser storage without explicit permission
- All API requests must use HTTPS
- The SDK should provide options for compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR

### 8.3. Scalability & performance
- The SDK should have minimal impact on application performance
- API requests should be optimized to reduce bandwidth usage
- Initialization should be asynchronous to not block the main thread
- The SDK should handle high volumes of concurrent requests gracefully
- Caching strategies should be implemented where appropriate

### 8.4. Potential challenges
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) issues with API requests
- Browser compatibility across different versions and vendors
- Security concerns with API key management
- Performance impact on host applications
- Versioning and backward compatibility as the SDK evolves
