# Embed Widget

The embed widget is a Vue.js component that can be embedded directly into client applications to collect user feedback. It's designed to be lightweight and customizable.

## Key Files

- Entry Point: [apps/embed/src/entry.ts](mdc:apps/embed/src/entry.ts)
- Main Application: [apps/embed/src/App.vue](mdc:apps/embed/src/App.vue)
- Component Library: [apps/embed/src/components](mdc:apps/embed/src/components)

## Bundle Output

The build process creates a bundled file that:
- Exposes a framework-agnostic Web Component
- Provides a basic JavaScript SDK for programmatic control
- Can be integrated into any frontend framework (React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- Maintains minimal dependencies to reduce payload size

## Integration Methods

The widget supports multiple integration methods:
- As a custom element / web component: `<pulse-feedback />`
- Through direct JavaScript SDK import: `import { PulseFeedback } from '@pulsekit/embed'`
- Via a script tag with auto-initialization: `<script src="pulsekit.js"></script>`

## Architecture

The embed widget communicates with the API to store feedback and retrieve existing items. It uses a lightweight design to minimize impact on the host application and maintains its own isolated state management to avoid conflicts with the parent application.
