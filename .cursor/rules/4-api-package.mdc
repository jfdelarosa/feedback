# API Package

The API package handles all backend functionality, including data storage, authentication, and business logic for the PulseKit platform.

## Key Directories

- Routes: [packages/api/src/routes](mdc:packages/api/src/routes) - API endpoints and controllers
- Database: [packages/api/src/db](mdc:packages/api/src/db) - Database models and queries
- Libraries: [packages/api/src/lib](mdc:packages/api/src/lib) - Utility functions and shared code

## Main Features

- Feedback Endpoints: CRUD operations for feedback items
- Authentication: User and team authentication 
- Data Persistence: Database schemas and queries
- Middleware: Request processing and validation

## Architecture

The API is built with TypeScript and uses:
- REST endpoints for standard CRUD operations
- Database ORM via Drizzle for type-safe database access
- JWT for authentication
